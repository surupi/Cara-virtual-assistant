I. What is the project all about?
We have created a virtual AI assistant CARA with help of Python and Python modules. CARA can help users in performing various class of tasks without moving their fingers. Users only have to give voice command to CARA as they are having conversation with someone in real life. CARA can also talk to users like a virtual friend.

II. Why do you think your project is important?
We are in the age of AI and the multitasking. Sometimes we need to multiple works at a time. Sometimes we want to relax our body while working. CARA is made for these things. It can help you in multitasking. It can entertain you, can talk to you and can play music for you too.

III. How did you develop the project(methodology)?
To develop CARA we use Python programming language, VS Code IDE and Jupyter Notebook. We used pyaudio module to take audio commands. We used Microsoft Eva as the voice of CARA and speech recognition module and google text to speech to identify the voice of user. We wrote different functions to perform different tasks.
